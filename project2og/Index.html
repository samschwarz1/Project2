        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> Radiohead is a UK-based band consisting of Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Colin Greenwood, Ed O'Brien, and Philip Selway. They have released 9 studio albums and hours of other singles and B-sides. Radiohead is one of the most critically acclaimed music groups, and my personal favorite.

        <h2>1. Weird Fishes / Arpeggi</h2>
        <p><img src="radiohead1.jpg" width="300" alt="Thom York dancing on stage behind red lights"><br><cite>Thom York by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Radiohead_on_stage_at_the_TRNSMT_Festival,_Glasgow_Green_(geograph_5454271).jpg" target="_blank">WikiMedia</a></cite></p>
            <p> Radiohead is a band which transcends genre. Over time the group has experimented with various instruments, drawing inspiration from the greats while keeping it distinctly Radiohead. On their 7th studio album “In Rainbows” they released a beautifully hypnotic song, Weird Fishes. Since this song came so late in the band's career they had plenty of time to discover their own style, straying from the original rock and roll sounds EMI (their record label) pressured them to create. I would consider this song Art Rock, consisting of harmonizing layered guitars and a flat drum texture. If you have never heard Radiohead, this song is a great way to dive in headfirst. Thom Yorke's wailing vocalsonly add to the dreamscape. </p>

            <h2>2. Fake Plastic Trees</h2>
            <p><img src="radiohead2.jpg" width="300" alt="Thom York playing guitar on stage behind blue lights"><br><cite>Thom York by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RadioheadMontreal170718-142_(29730184138).jpg" target="_blank">WikiMedia</a></cite></p>
            <p>Fake Plastic Trees was released as the lead single of Radiohead's second album, The Bends. This Radio smasher was adored by critics and the public, selling 400,000 copies in the UK alone. This track is distinctly rock and roll, and is my personal favorite rock song from Radiohead's, Thoms vocals were at their best, and the guitar composition feels advanced for a rock song. Fake Plastic Trees can be considered a crescendo, one of my favorite musical elements. My favorite performance of this song is on Conan O'brien's talk show where the band performed it live in the studio.  </p>

        <h2>Everything In Its Right Place</h2>

            <p>Kid A, the most successful left turn in musical history. Coming off the commercial success of their third album, Ok Computer, the band was burned out. The tour schedule left them hating rock music and themselves. The solution? Kid A. This experimental electronica album caught the word off guard, the drowning synths and electronic vocals came as a shock, but many loved it. The first track, Everything in its Right Place sets the mood for Kid A. Reversed vocals looming in the background while heavy synths set the tone, not to mention Thoms seemingly gibberish lyrics clearly enunciated. I remember the first time I heard Everything in Its Right Place, I was moping the floors at work, and I must have played it back 10 times completely engulfed in the new world Radiohead had created. </p>

        <h2>There, There</h2>

            <p>This Melodic rock song debuted on Radiohead's sixth studio album, Hail To The Thief. Although the album was rated highly by critics and the public it was still considered a flop for Radiohead, their bar was simply set too high. For the band to feel comfortable experimenting with new sounds again they needed to break expectations. There, There is a melodic rock song seeing Radiohead moving back towards their roots. My favorite portion of the song is the electric guitar riff towards the end of the song. This song can also be considered a crescendo. </p>

        <h2>Daydreaming</h2>
            <p><img src="radiohead5.jpg" width="300" alt="Thom York playing guitar on stage behind green lights"><br><cite>Thom York by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RadioheadMontreal170718-163_(41792364210).jpg" target="_blank">WikiMedia</a></cite></p>
            <p>A Moon Shaped Pool is Radiohead's most recent album, and their most heartfelt. The second single, Daydreaming is a standout for me. The song boasts a beautiful piano melody paired with soft electronic sounds reminiscent of C418, a great German musician famous for creating the Minecraft soundtrack. When the string composure by Jonny Greenwood harmonizes with the piano and Thoms looping vocals I can't help but get goose bumps every time I hear it. When I first heard Daydreaming the melody was so stuck in my head, I had to learn the piano coords to play it out myself.</p>
